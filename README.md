# CS-255

DriverPass wanted to build a web-based application to train new drivers to succeed on their DMV driving test. They want to provide up-to-date DMV ruling included in their online lessons, and allow customers to book in-person driving lessons for live feedback.

I feel like I interpretted the requirements of DriverPass well and was able to create a good presentation of how we could implement their goals.

I would revise my UML use case diagram to include the IT professional described in the interview.

I read over the initial interview and tried to take the design step by step and include the requirements outlined in the interview as they came up in the interview.

I try to do my research on the best tools, languages, and tools to make the implementation of the program the most effeicient and affective as possible. Prior planning is essential to a smooth development.
